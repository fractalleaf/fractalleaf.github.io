## About this blog

I enjoy working on hobby projects connected to data analysis, algorithms and
puzzles. The purpose of this blog is simply to function as an outlet for the
projects I work on.

If you also enjoy some of these subjects, hopefully you will find the blog's
content interesting.

## About me

I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, where I also work as a data scientist. I have a
background in astrophysics where I studied star formation; primarily by
analysing data from large simulations.
