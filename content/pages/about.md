## About this blog

I enjoy working on hobby projects connected to data analysis, algorithms and
puzzles. The purpose of this blog is simply as an outlet of some of the projects
I work on.

If you enjoy some of the same things, you will hopefully find some interesting
stuff on the blog.

## About me

I live in Copenhagen, Denmark, where I work as a Data Scientist. I have a
background in astrophysics where I mainly worked with computer simulations of
star-forming regions.
