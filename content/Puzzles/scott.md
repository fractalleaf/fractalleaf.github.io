In my previous [post]({filename}/Algorithms/dlx.md), I introduced exact cover problems, and described Knuth's DLX algorithm for solving such problems. In this post, I use the DLX algorithm to solve a famous exact cover problem: [Scott's Pentomino problem]({filename}/pdf/ScottCombiPuz.pdf).

## Problem statement
Scott's pentomino problem can be stated as follows:

> Consider a 8x8 square with a 2x2 hole in the centre. Cover each tile with one of the 12 free [pentominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino) in such a way that no pentominoes overlap, and each pentomino is used only once.

One of the many solutions to the problem is shown below

## Background
Scott's pentomino problem is named after [Dana Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scott) and is famous, not because Scott was the first to solve the problem, but because it was one of the first experiments with solving such a problem algorithmically. The problem was chosen because it was known to have a lot of solutions, but relatively few possibilities of placing the pieces on the grid, thus making the problem computationally feasible.

The experiment was run in 1958 on the [MANIAC I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANIAC_I) computer at Princeton, where Scott was a graduate student. In the [technical report]({filename}/pdf/ScottCombiPuz.pdf), where Scott published the results, he remarked that he was very pleased that

> The whole problem required only about three and one-half hours.

## Pentominoes
A pentomino is a polygon constructed by five squares connected edge-to-edge. The pentominoes are a subset of the polyminoes: An Nth order polymino are polygons constructed by connecting N squares edge-to-edge, making pentominoes are 5th order polyminoes. Other well known polyminoes are tetrominoes (tetris blocks), which are 4th order polyminoes, and dominoes which are 2nd order polyminoes.

</figure>

Ignoring reflections and rotations, there are 12 "free" pentominoes, which are shown above along with the customary name of each pentomino. It is customary to name the pentominoes after the letter in the alphabeth they resemble the most.

## Placing pentominoes on the grid
To solve the pentomino problem using the DLX algorithm we need to record all valid pentomino positions on the grid. To help with this task, I have created two python classes:

* The `Polymino` class takes the polymino name and coordinates as input, and defines methods for manipulating the pentomino position and orientation.
* The `Grid` class defines a grid (possibly with holes) on which Polyminoes can be placed. The Grid class checks if each polymino placement in valid.

The first step is to create 12 instanes of the `Polymino` class. One for each of the free pentominoes. I have made a convenience function, `generate_polyminoes`, which takes ascii drawings of the polyminoes and generates the `Polymino` instances from those.


```python
from collections import defaultdict
from polymino import Polymino

def generate_polyminoes(ascii_drawing):
    """Generate polymino coordinates from ascii drawing

    Args:
        ascii_drawing (str): An ascii drawing of the polyminoes to be
        generated. Polyminoes must be drawn using ascii characters, where the
        polymino gets named after the ascii character.

    Yields:
        List of Polymino class instances.
    """

    # get coordinates for each polymino in the ascii drawing
    polydic = defaultdict(list)
    for i, row in enumerate(ascii_drawing.split('\n')):
        for j, name in enumerate(row):
            if name != ' ':
                polydic[name].append((i, j))

    # yield Polymino objects with each polymino shifted to (0, 0)
    for key in sorted(polydic.keys()):
        polymino = Polymino(key, polydic[key])
        polymino.absolute_shift(0, 0)
        yield polymino

# Ascii drawing of the 12 free pentominoes
PENTOMINOES = """
    I
    I  L   N                         Y
 FF I  L   N PP TTT       V   W  X  YY ZZ
FF  I  L  NN PP  T  U U   V  WW XXX  Y  Z
 F  I  LL N  P   T  UUU VVV WW   X   Y  ZZ
"""

pentominoes = []
for pentomino in generate_polyminoes(PENTOMINOES):
    pentominoes.append(pentomino)

print("Number of free pentominoes = {}".format(len(pentominoes)))
```

    Number of free pentominoes = 12


The second step is to generate all "fixed" pentominoes by flipping and rotating the pentominoes. The number of distinct orientations for each pentomino vary between 1 to 8 depending on the symmetries of the piece.


```python
from copy import deepcopy

def generate_polymino_orientations(polyminoes):
    """Generate all orientations (flips and rotations) of a polymino.

    Args:
        polyminoes: List of polyminoes to generate orientations of.

    Yields:
        Polymino instance.
    """
    polyminoes = [polyminoes] if isinstance(polyminoes, Polymino) else polyminoes

    for polymino in polyminoes:

        for _ in range(4):
            yield deepcopy(polymino)
            polymino.rotate()

        polymino.flip()

        for _ in range(4):
            yield deepcopy(polymino)
            polymino.rotate()

orientations = []
count = defaultdict(int)
for pentomino in generate_polymino_orientations(pentominoes):
    if pentomino not in orientations: # only include unique orientations
        orientations.append(pentomino)
        count[pentomino.name] += 1

for name, cnt in count.items():
    print("{} pentomino has {} distinct flips/rotations".format(name, cnt))
print("Total number of distinct pentomino orientations = {}".format(len(orientations)))
```

    F pentomino has 8 distinct flips/rotations
    I pentomino has 2 distinct flips/rotations
    L pentomino has 8 distinct flips/rotations
    N pentomino has 8 distinct flips/rotations
    P pentomino has 8 distinct flips/rotations
    T pentomino has 4 distinct flips/rotations
    U pentomino has 4 distinct flips/rotations
    V pentomino has 4 distinct flips/rotations
    W pentomino has 4 distinct flips/rotations
    X pentomino has 1 distinct flips/rotations
    Y pentomino has 8 distinct flips/rotations
    Z pentomino has 4 distinct flips/rotations
    Total number of distinct pentomino orientations = 63


Finally, each fixed pentomino is placed at all valid positions on the grid.


```python
from polymino import Grid

def generate_polymino_positions(polyminoes, grid):
    """Place polyminoes on all valid positions in the grid

    Args:
        polyminoes: List of polyminoes to place on grid
        grid: Grid instance.

    Yields:
        Polymino instance.
    """
    polyminoes = [polyminoes] if isinstance(polyminoes, Polymino) else polyminoes

    for polymino in polyminoes:
        for i in range(grid.min_i, grid.min_i+grid.size[0]):
            for j in range(grid.min_j, grid.min_j+grid.size[1]):
                polymino.absolute_shift(i, j)
                if grid.valid_position(polymino):
                    yield deepcopy(polymino)

# create 8x8 grid with 2x2 hole in the middle
grid = Grid((8, 8), holes=[(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)])
positions = []
for pentomino in generate_polymino_positions(orientations, grid):
    positions.append(pentomino)

print("Total number of fixed pentomino positions on grid = {}".format(len(positions)))
```

    Total number of fixed pentomino positions on grid = 1568


## Solving the problem with DLX

The result of placing the fixed pentominoes on the grid yields a collection of sets, that the DLX algorithm uses for finding exact cover solutions.

The final steps before running the solver is to calculate a list of all the elements present in one or more of the sets in the collection. Each of these elements represent a constraint that must be satisfied once, and only once, by the solution. The problem at hand has two constraints:

* The grid points: A grid point has to be covered by a pentomino, but pentominoes cannot overlap.
* The pentomino names: Each pentomino has to be used once, and cannot be used after that.


```python
# convert list of Polymino instances to list of lists (for input to DLX)
positions = [pentomino.aslist for pentomino in positions]

# DLX also needs a set of labels (constraints) as input. Generate from the list of pentominoes
labels = list(set([element for pentomino in positions for element in pentomino]))
labels = sorted(labels, key=sortkey)
```

Finally, we are ready to run the DLX solver


```python
from dlx import DLX

# sort key for sorted function
# puts strings to the front of list, and coordinates after strings
def sortkey(x):
    x = str(x)
    return (len(x), x)

dlx = DLX(labels, positions)

solutions = dlx.run_search(key=sortkey)
# convert to Grid objects
solutions = [Grid.from_DLX(solution) for solution in solutions]

print("Number of solutions found by DLX = {}".format(len(solutions)))
```

    Number of solutions found by DLX = 520


DLX finds a total of 520 solutions, however, because the algorithm does not take rotations and reflections into account, each solution is replicated eight times with different orientations (see below). The number of distinct solutions is therefore equal to $520/8 = 65$.

<figure align="middle">
  <img src="{filename}/Puzzles/images/scott_pentomino_non_unique.svg" title="Non-distinct solutions">
  <figcaption>Eight solutions of the pentomino problem that are all different orientations of the same solution.</figcaption>
</figure>

It is easy to root out the non-distinct solutions. One simply generates all eight orientations of each solution, only including the solution if it is not already in the list of accepted solutions.


```python
def generate_grid_orientations(grids):
    """Generate all orientations (flips and rotations) of a grid.

    Args:
        grids: List of grids to generate orientations of.

    Yields:
        Grid instance.
    """

    grids = [grids] if isinstance(grids, Grid) else grids

    for grid in grids:
        for _ in range(4):
            yield deepcopy(grid)
            grid.rotate()

        grid.flip()

        for _ in range(4):
            yield deepcopy(grid)
            grid.rotate()

def unique_grids(grids):

    grids = list(grids)

    unique = [grids[0]]

    for grid in grids[1:]:
        is_unique = True
        for orientation in generate_grid_orientations(grid):
            if orientation in unique:
                is_unique = False
                break
        if is_unique:
            unique.append(grid)

    return unique

distinct = unique_grids(solutions)

print("Number of distinct solutions = {}".format(len(distinct)))
```

    Number of distinct solutions = 65


The 65 distinct solutions are shown below

## Optimising the algorithm


```python
%timeit dlx.run_search(key=sortkey)
print("Number of calls to recursive search function = {}".format(sum(dlx.kcount)))
```

    1min 31s Â± 852 ms per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
    Number of calls to recursive search function = 293045


The algorithm runs in 1.5 minutes, and makes 293045 calls to the recursive search function. While the runtime is certainly better than the 3.5 hours achieved by Scott in 1958, it is far from optimal.

The most obvious way to reduce the runtime would be to implement the algorithm in a compiled language or run it on a faster computer. However, none of these solutions would reduce the number of calls to the recursive search function, which is what drives the running time.

Scott noticed that you can avoid generating a lot of the redundant solutions by restricting the placement of the X pentomino in such a way that none of the accepted placements can be flipped or rotated into one of the other placements. Doing this, there is in fact only three valid placements of the X pentomino:

![]({filename}/Puzzles/images/X.svg)

Restricting the placement of the X piece reduces the branching of the search tree, and therefore also the number of calls to the recursive search function.

Note, that restricting the placement of the X polymino to the three shown positions does not remove all symmetries as the rightmost placement retains one axis of symmetry with the diagonal. Although it is possible to remove this ambiguity by restricting the placement of one additional pentomino, I will ignore this here, and simply remove all non-distinct solutions after running the solver anew.


```python
print("Number of valid positions before removing X pieces = {}".format(len(positions)))

# remove X pieces from position except those with the desired coordinates
positions = [pos for pos in positions if not (pos[0] == 'X' and pos[1] not in [(5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)])]

print("Number of valid positions after removing X pieces = {}".format(len(positions)))

# run DLX algorithm again
dlx = DLX(labels, positions)

solutions = dlx.run_search(key=sortkey)
# convert to Grid objects
solutions = [Grid.from_DLX(solution) for solution in solutions]

print("")
print("Number of solutions found by DLX with X pieces removed = {}".format(len(solutions)))

#remove non-distinct solutions
distinct = unique_grids(solutions)

print("Number of distinct solutions found by DLX with X pieces removed = {}".format(len(distinct)))

print("")
%timeit dlx.run_search(key=sortkey)
print("Number of calls to recursive search function = {}".format(sum(dlx.kcount)))
```

    Number of valid positions before removing X pieces = 1568
    Number of valid positions after removing X pieces = 1547
    
    Number of solutions found by DLX with X pieces removed = 91
    Number of distinct solutions found by DLX with X pieces removed = 65
    
    15.5 s Â± 320 ms per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
    Number of calls to recursive search function = 49874


Restricting the positioning of the X pentominoes reduces both the runtime and the number of recusive calls by a factor of six.
